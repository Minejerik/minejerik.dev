Hello Again!

I have been spending the last few months working on building up my homelab infrastructure, and I have recently been able to bring up my new server, An hp Proliant dl360p gen 8, running proxmox.
Once I setup proxmox on said server, I have been moving more and more of software into proxmox vms.
