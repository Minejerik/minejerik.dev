###### Factorio mods released every year

Hello! I am back again to show you what I have been doing over the past few days.
I like the game factorio, in fact I have a few hundred hours in it on steam.
This was inspired by a reddit post on r/factorio, where somebody collected mod data and made a network visualization of the dependencies.
I was intrigued by this reddit post and started looking around for an api for the factorio mod portal, I found one on [this page](https://wiki.factorio.com/Mod_portal_API).

So I started collecting data, first thing I did was ping the api for all of the mods name's I stored these names into a json file.
After I got all of the names of the mods, I went through all of the names and pinged the api for more information per mod. Then I added the json response and the name to a database, I didn't parse the json yet I just wanted to get it all.
Once I got all of the data I started working on parsing the json into a new database schema. Once I did this I was able to get a database of pure information.

## The Fun Part
Now its time for the fun part, visulization of the data.

First Image/Graph:

![Factorio Mod Licences](/static/5/modlicences.jpg)
This one shows the licences for factorio mods, I removed the data for licences that have less than 10 mods because then the graph would not be readable.
You can see that MIT, The Unlicence, and the GPLv3 are the most common licences for factorio mods.

Next Image/Graph:

![Factorio Mod Catagories](/static/5/modcatagories.jpg)

This one has the catagories for the mods, you can see that n/a is very common, this is because some of the json data did not contain a catagory so I simply replaced it with n/a. This shows that content and tweaks are the most popular kinds of mods.

Last Image/Graph:

![Factorio mode release years](/static/5/modsyear.jpg)

This was was shown earlier, but it simply shows the ammount of mods released in a year. You can see that 2020 and 2023 were both the most popular years for factorio/factorio mods.

Thank you for reading, This one is a bit more simple but I thought it was still interesting.
