Hello! I have decided to explain how this blog works. This blog uses markdown which is used for formating + metadata for blog posts.

## Simple Explanation

This section is just a simple explanation for my blog, for a more advanced explanation scroll down. 
Every single one of my blog post's are stored in a blog folder in the root of my flask project.     
Every markdown files name is just a number, for example my first blog post's file name was `1.md` and this blog post's file name is `2.md` this sets the id for the blog post.

Everyone of the markdown files have metadata at the top of the file. 
This metadata includes:

1. TITLE, this title is used for the heading and the title of the tab for the post.    
2. SOURCE, this is the `href` for the source link at the top of the posts.     
3. DATE, this is a string that has the date that I wrote the post, I could theoretically set the date to anything.   

## Advanced Explanation

My code simply reads the first 3 lines of the markdown file, and then caches it so that in the future no file operations need to occur. 
This caching of the data speeds up the response by a lot.
However it means that I need to restart the the server to clear the cache while I write these blog posts.

## Conclusion

The way I represent blog posts has advantages and disadvantages, it is quick but it does not allow for comments or likes.

A reason I did it like this wo/ a database is that I felt that this should be a simple project and needing a database would make this simple project overcomplicated.

Thank you for reading! I hope you found it informative!
