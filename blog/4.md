567 days.


I have been using replit for 567 days (as of writing).


As the days passed I have seen how replit has changed.


replit has gotten better in some ways, but it has also gotten significantly worse in others.


replit has added, and recently removed, the pro tier of their subscription. In fact replit has removed all of the old tiers of their subscription and replaced all of them with one tier


"core"


A stupid name for a stupid change.


also the change that will affect every user, they added per-account storage limits compared to the per-repl limits of before.

this means that before, when you could have unlimited repls with a max of 1 GiB per repl, now you can have unlimited repls but only 10 gib in total for all of them.

they say that they are "trying to get the next billion developers programming" but then they do stuff like this, which makes it so people have to limit the size of their projects.

which means that it probably won't get more people programming.

which defeats the purpose of their website.


## what they could do

they could revert all of the recent changes, that is it.

if they reverted a lot of their changes that make the website harder to use, people would probably enjoy replit more.
