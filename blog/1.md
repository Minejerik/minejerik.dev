# Implementation of the genetic algorithm in pygame

Hello! this is my new blog and website and I decided to kick it of with something interesting . 
I have spent the last few days reaserching the genetic algorithm, and I decided to implement it into pygame .

## Explanation

Each of the agents, which are being represented as green dots, have a list of moves . 
This list is 250 moves long, each moves is one of 5 possible move types represented by there numbers .

1. Move left 1 x coordinate
1. Move up 1 y coordinate
1. Move right 1 x coordinate
1. Move down 1 y coordinate
1. Sleep for an update cycle

After each agent either reaches the goal or runs out of moves the next generation begins .
A generation is created by selecting the best agent from the last generation, making copies of it and then mutating all of the copys .

The best of the last generation is also included in the next generation just to insure that there is no way for a generation to be worse then the last .
The best of the previous generation is colored blue to distinguish it from its fellow agents .

This basic loop repeats until the user decides to stop the application .

## Scoring

This section is about how the agents are scored . This score is then used to select the best agent out of all of them .

Here is the scoring code .

    def value(ag):
      dist = hypot(ag.x-goalx,ag.y-goaly)
      if ag.reached_goal:
        return 10000.0/(ag.move_count*ag.move_count)
      else:
        return 1.0/(dist*dist)

This code returns 10000 divided by the amount of moves the agent has made in its life span if the agent made it to the goal.    
If the agent didn't make it to the goal, it's score is based on 1 divided by the distance to the goal squared.

I have done it like this so that even the worst agent that reaches the goal will get a higher score then even the best agent that doesnt reach the goal.

## Mutation

This section is about how the movelists of the agents are mutate once they are created.

Here is the code for mutating the list of moves.

    def mutate(self):
      mutrate = 0.1
      for i in range(len(self.moves)):
        rand = random()
        if rand < mutrate:
          self.moves[i] = choice(moves)
      
It goes through all of the moves and gets a random float from 0-1 (rand), if this number is less then the mutation rate (mutrate) a new random move is chosen from the list of possible moves.   

This may look like it won't work due to its simplicity, but in practice it works very well.

## In practice

###### this graph shows how over 60 generations the amount of moves the best agent needs to get to goal decreases
